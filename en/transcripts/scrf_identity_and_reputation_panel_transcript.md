## Transcript

**Eugene Leventhal:** Hello and welcome to the panel on Identity and Reputation, which is organized by the Smart Contract Research Forum or SCRF as part of this Smart Contract Summit that's happening this year. I'm Eugene Leventhal, the Operations Lead at SCRF and I have the pleasure of moderating today's panel, which is going to be exploring the question of what role distributed ledger technology can play in reducing wealth inequality and in terms of building stronger communities. We're specifically going to be getting into the role that identity and reputation play in this context. But without further ado, let me introduce our panelists today and then we'll get to each panelist presenting briefly, and then we'll jump into a moderated discussion. So first off I just want to say thank you to our two panelists today Cemil Turun and professor Seth Copen Goldstein.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** Thanks for having us.

**Cemil Turun:** Hi, thanks.

**Eugene Leventhal:** [1:05] So let me just start off with some quick bios and then we'll get into the presentations. So Cemil is an entrepreneur artists engineer and part-time academic. He has 20 plus years in the background of digital currencies and gaming. Within an early-stage startup, his team has developed the 3D virtual world and a real-world compatible currency with venture capital from Silicon Valley on a project he had worked on between 2008 and 2014. Since 2018, Cemil is the co-founder of a startup inspired by 40-year-old decentralized credit creation instrument used in Turkey that we'll hear more about today. He is also teaching a course on block chains at Istanbul's prestigious Boğaziçi University.

**Cemil Turun:** Yeah. Boğaziçi, it's a bit difficult one.

**Eugene Leventhal:** I hope I wasn't too far off, at least hopefully people will recognize the name.

**Cemil Turun:** Yes. Thank you.

**Eugene Leventhal:** So thanks for joining Cemil. And we also have professor Seth Copen Goldstein, who has been a faculty member in the department of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University since 1997. He received his Ph.D. in computer science at UC Berkeley and his BS from Princeton University. Seth's main research agenda focuses broadly on ensembles, that's large collections of interacting agents, where he has explored topics such as reconfigurable computing, how ensembles of molecules could be used to create circuits, and programmable matter just to name a few. Most pertinent for today's discussion Seth has moved his focus to ensembles of people, and he's investigating the interaction of technology work and money since returning from his most recent startup. In particular, Seth is interested in understanding quantitatively the impact of technological progress on the labor market and innovation.

**Eugene Leventhal:** He's developing social technology and alternative monetary systems that can reduce poverty and opportunity inequality as well as support innovation and creativity in a post-labor economy. Seth's main effort is ZUZ which is a financial inclusion tool that combines lending and payment on a single distributed ledger-based system. ZUZ builds on local trust to increase access to capital and creates a functioning bottom-up community currency from each individually issued token for ZUZ. And so now let me go ahead and pass it off to Cemil who will provide a presentation on Defterhane and his project.

**Cemil Turun:** [3:35] Thank you. So I'm sharing the screen now.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Yes.

**Cemil Turun:** Okay. All right. My presentation today I will try to be brief in five, six minutes is about trust-based credit system on blockchain that is being used in Turkey for more than 40 years. As a beginning, I must tell initially that money version 1.0 was not this one, Lydia's gold lion coins as initially thought which were coins around 500 BC also in today's Turkey what we call Sardis, but rather the original money version the 1.0 was actually the accounting and credit certificates that were used in tablet form by the Sumerians. And this is about 2000 years before then Lydian golden coins. And now that certificate's found in a Turkish museum, sorry for this slanted picture I took with my phone.

**Cemil Turun:** [4:55] This is from BC 1800s and it's about debt between two tradesmen. And it's really interesting since in my presentation I will come momentarily to our mechanism, very similar to the one that was recorded in those 2000-year-old or more 2,500 years old documents on tablets. So let's come to blockchain, the core of disruption in blockchains is, of course, decentralized nature of the creation of new type of money for example with Bitcoin, it is described as trustless network of people and nodes, and each user has a copy of the ledger and participates in confirming transactions independently. And I try to show it on the right-hand side. This is the topology of Satoshi's creation of Bitcoin. However, in the actual world users are not anonymous to neighboring nodes and each node has a trust network of nodes in the real world cases of internet.

**Cemil Turun:** [6:27] And in our case, in the case that I'll just describe in a moment, we also need to have a trust between persons on the network. One last thing to show is how do the banks earn their money today. Banks are in 10% of their income from remittance or EFT transfer or other forms of money but they earn majority of their income from loans which are credits, extended credit to businesses and people and they charge fees and interest on them. However, the today's cryptos are all about that 10%, which is mostly about moving money. However, then the other 90%, which is the credit side is not addressed at all. Well, there is defy but of course, defy is not the same type of credit creation that we see in the real world situation today. So Bitcoin is basically about transactions and cryptocurrency transfer on insecure networks.

**Cemil Turun:** Now let's come to this interesting well, ideally check example, which is a mechanism that has been used for more than 40 years in modern Turkey. And this is based on bank checks, the checks that are created that are given to trace people and SMEs small and medium-sized corporations by the banks. And however they are used in a completely different form, it's not used like the checks in the Western world. So here in Turkey, somebody when he or she gives a check to the second party it is 100% of the times with the future day, usually six months or eight months ahead of the day that the check is signed. And so after this point, this paper acts like payments method and changes hands usually 10, 15 times but the average is five. And with this interesting mechanism, people essentially create their own money in terms of future credits.

**Cemil Turun:** And this is totally and completely based on trust. So people trusting each other usually in pairs, essentially in pairs, and then for instance in example, the first person Ali gives the check to Bora, second person, and Bora has to trust Ali otherwise it won't happen. So these two people, the two tradesmen or SME owners, in this case, they create money out of their own credibility, essentially Ali's credibility. Then Bora can pass this to Ceren by a signature on the back side of the paper and the trust direction is from right to left. And also note that here Ceren and the third person does not need to know Ali and Demir does not need to know Bora. So this is kind of, it works between two people. And for the last slide, I want to give you the size of this economy in modern Turkey, I have the 2018 data.

**Cemil Turun:** [9:58] And in that year, Turkish SMEs had issue 21 million while it did the checks with a total face value of 940 [billion Turkish Lira], almost one trillion Turkish Lira and this was to $200 billion in 2018 numbers and average velocity that is number of hands of each check was five. So the total economy based on people's reputation, reputation-based credit system was about $1 trillion US dollars in 2018. So this is interesting example I want to put to the interest of researchers and blockchain engineers all over the world. Here commerce depends on reputation and reputation-based creation ability and nothing else. So we have a new and my startup is actually about blockchain-based mechanism exactly like this one, we're kind of copying this real-world example on smart contracts that we plan to work on theory. So this is about it, and I hope it is a useful as a first understanding. Thanks.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Great. Thanks so much for presenting Cemil and I'll pass it off now to Seth so he can talk a little bit about his project before we get into the moderated discussion.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [11:35] Thank you, Eugene, and thank you, Cemil. So the project I want to talk about today is called ZUZ and basically, this is a system to build on local trust, very similar to what Cemil was talking about, and that use credit or lending and payment on a single platform. So Bob Hope very humorously talked about how a bank is a place to get money if you don't need it, but in the real world, this is actually a serious problem, at least in the United States. Main street banks are failing, small and medium-sized businesses they're lending less and less to these businesses over time and 85% of small and medium-sized businesses report needing more capital to grow is the essential problem. The reason for this is that the cost of a loan of $10,000 or $10 million is essentially the same to the bank and their relationships or reputation that business owners had with their banks is sort of disappearing as community banks, which have been the historical lender are closing at a rapid rate.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [12:55] Not only that, if you're a woman-owned or minority-owned, smaller and medium-sized business you get significantly less than your fair share of the amount of money loaned. So that's one part of the problem that businesses can't get access to capital to grow. The other part of the problem is that communities themselves are being hurt by the sort of globalization of e-commerce and such. If you spend a $100 in your local community at a locally owned store, the community keeps 68 of those dollars and that makes for healthy communities. If you spend that same $100 at a big box store at online mega store like Amazon, the community keeps only a dollar. So we want to tackle both the problem of access to capital and local liquidity in a community. So our solution is based on the fact that reputation, that you have in your community is something that you can turn into capital.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** It's a two-sided solution, where on the same platform we're both lending money and using the platform essentially the loans to be able to pay for goods and services, in some sense this is the 90% of the pie integrated with the 10% of the pie that Cemil was talking about. So merchants can raise money from the community by putting together what you could think of it is a crowd funding platform campaign. And that campaign runs on the website so it's also a marketing activity and individuals that care about that merchant that want to support it can come and buy their ZUZ, essentially think of it as a digital gift card or a loan instrument. And so they buy this digital gift card from the merchant and ends up in their wallet, the merchant gets some cash, that's the capital they're raising, and then the consumers A might get maybe these digital gift cards pay interest rate.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [15:08] So there's a little bit of self-interest involved here. They get to support the business and essentially inject capital into their community which is good for supporting the entire community and of course, this is all easy to use because of the digital ledger technology on the wallet application that runs on top. So how does this work? Let's say Blake's bakery wants to raise some money, so Omari is a big fan of Blake's bakery. She loves Blake's cupcakes or whatever and so she will buy some Blake's bakery ZUZ in exchange for some local currency. Now Blake has let's say $20 worth of US dollars that Omari gave him and Omari now has $20 worth of Blake's bakeries. Now she can of course use that to buy a cup of coffee or something at a later date but because this is all on a digital ledger and everybody can see the transactions, and this is where sort of identity and reputation come in Omari can also potentially spend her Blake's bakeries at Dakota's hardware store.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** This is the equivalent of the fidelity checks where someone is essentially signing the back and giving it to somebody else. So now the question is why would Dakota take Blake's bakeries ZUZ? Well, we're all part of a community, essentially think of it as a social graph where Charlie's salon is doing business with Blake's bakeries, is doing business with Dakota's hardware. And once one person is willing to accept someone else's ZUZ then what happens is that instrument becomes liquid. And it's exactly like what Cemil was talking about where we get this fractional banking injecting more capital into this local economy. So think about it. Blake's bakery got $20 of a United States currency and Dakota got $20 worth of Blake's bakeries and so now the community has $40 worth of value. Because of this, the communities grow stronger, the trust in the community grows and there is not just a correlation but causation between increased trust and increased wealth.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [17:46] And so you get this sort of digital small-town feel because all of these individual pairwise transactions are recorded on the ledger and everyone can see that for example, Blake's bakeries are flowing liquidly in the community and we get increased money or value in the community itself. The ZUZ protocol runs on a distributed ledger. It's sort of agnostic about that and of course, there's a wallet to keep track of everything and in the long run, because all of these transactions are happening on the ledger you can imagine mining the ledger to create sort of reputation metrics that are potentially correlated with default risk to make it possible for these small businesses to access large amounts of capital from the sort of mainstream banking community because all of a sudden now they have a quantifiable metric they can use to make a loan. And so I'll leave it there and if you have questions I'm happy to take them at info@zuzlab.com. Thank you.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Great, thank you both for presenting and we'll make sure to include links and easy ways for people to learn more and follow up in the forum posts that we create around this and I'll plug that at the end. But I just wanted to start by kind of asking you both a question relating to something that was alluded to in both of your presentations, the role that trust plays in these kinds of systems. And I think it's an interesting question to start off with in terms of how you build trust in these systems, whether it's people trusting the system itself or people trusting each other to want to use such a system. So either one of you mind jumping in on that one.

**Cemil Turun:** Okay. Seth, do you want to go first?

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [19:39] Sure. Although I think that you have easier time with answering this question given the social foundation of what's happening with these future data checks in Turkey. So there, there's sort of a sociological foundation for building this trust. I think that building trust in the system, well, that happens all the time, you can release your code from your ledger, everyone can read the ledger but of course, there has to be some basic trust in the system. But on top of that, there has to be trust of each other and the first question that people ask me a lot is, well, what happens if Blake's bakery defaults? What happens to my ZUZ that I own? And that is an important question and it is a loan in that sense.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [20:36] And that's why knowing sort of being transparent and actually having the real-world identity of the issuers of ZUZ is absolutely essential. And I know this runs counter to people's intuition about what distributed ledger technology is about. I mean, people think about blockchain and anonymity but in the end, cryptographically secure signatures and identities are what are going to make this work. And there are mechanisms you can build into the system that allow people, for instance, confirm that the ZUZ they're selling are related to their business. And I think it's a matter of seeing the transactions on roll over time and you get more and more trust.

**Cemil Turun:** [21:25] Excellent. I will give an example for this question that I heard from my late uncle who was in Bursa's Covered Bazaar. He worked as trusted escrow person for these kinds of transactions. So imagine a city, the size of about half million, it's called Bursa and it has a Covered Bazaar the year 1950 and two tradesmen they buy silk clothing or the silk textiles from one to the other. And one of the tradesmen says, I will pay you 10,000 liras six months ahead and they shake hands. And this happens in front of my uncle, who is the escrow person, assigned person for this transaction and there is no paper involved in this situation, just trust, the names, the reputation. In a small community of tradesmen, it's very important to actually follow your word or honor your word and always pay in time to the other person. And the third person, my uncle being the escrow person actually has a small notebook and takes notes of these transactions that takes part in front of him, kind of a referee.

**Cemil Turun:** [22:47] And this one things went bigger and many other cities involved necessitated another kind of escrow and in that case, they used later on in 1980s, the bank checks as a kind of an escrow mechanism rather than human beings. So bank checks were used like an escrow mechanism for the reputation carrier between cities. But still, you must understand that this is a reputation-based currency, reputation-based or trust-based transaction, complete trust-based transaction between trading people. And this goes back to many thousand years and what people did with the checks and paper was just copy this on analog mechanism and put it on another paper or oral mechanism and they put it on paper. And now what we try to make is to put it on a trusted, decentralized ledger and not break the mechanism because it is decentralized. There is no central bank, there is no bank, et cetera. So I hope I can give you this as set, it's a such sociological long term build trust between humans in a community.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [24:19] I think just to add to that for a second, I think that the history of our civilization is one of people coming together to do things together and reputation even if it wasn't quantifiable has always been a part of how we interact. And so the question is can we sort of create a little bit more incentive to build up that reputation? And I think that's what the transparency of the ledger provides here, particularly in bigger and bigger communities.

**Cemil Turun:** [24:57] Very true, because it was in time, it was abused by people who used the non-transparent nature of the bigger mechanism. And as Seth says, I think we have to rebuild this reputation and trust the mechanism using blockchains.

**Eugene Leventhal:** And so I want to dig into something that was alluded to in both of your answers in terms of the role that identity plays in some of these systems and the idea that it needs to be a real-world identity. I know you explicitly said that Seth and Cemil in the example you gave, I mean, your uncle knew those people. He knows their names presumably where they live in the community, et cetera. So a two-part question, is there a specific reason you think it absolutely needs to be sort of a fully disclosed identity? And the second part is once the system is established enough, can a pseudo-anonymous entity gain enough reputation over time that it becomes okay. If I want to use my online handle, as opposed to Eugene Leventhal for whatever reason?

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [26:05] So I think that that is essential to make this a working system, not every transaction everybody wants to do, do they want disclosed. But there are ways because we have smart contracts underlying this to get both the advantages of the real-world identity so that defectors are essentially punished, which encourages trusting the system and following the system and allowing people to have some of the attributes of an anonymous transaction. So for instance, in ZUZ you have a real-world identity then people know who you are, but you can have as many identities as you want. Now, clearly, an identity with no transactions behind it has no reputation by definition, but there is a smart contract that we have where essentially one user will say, I trust another user's currency, another user ZUZ.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [27:09] And what they're saying is I will guarantee to back that up. So you can imagine that someone says, I want to do the following transactions anonymously so I'm going to create this new identity and I'm going to go to a service that I pay to trust my currency. And so now people know this isn't anonymous identity but it's trusted by a third party. So in this sense, I think we see that there's some trade-off here between the amount of sort of anonymity you want to have and some costs to that anonymity, which I think does mirror many real-world transactions. So it's possible using smart contracts to get that anonymity you want and yet still have sort of a reputation-based system.

**Cemil Turun:** [27:56] Yes. Very similar answer. I think I can give, I'm not going to add anything new to what Seth said but as he said, on a top layer there is a reputation-based larger transaction size flow of credit. And on the bottom, there is another layer of anonymous, smaller transactions possible because of the first layers trust and confidentiality. So maybe users of the first layer can say, okay, this amount I secure it with my own trust. So other people can use my trust and transact my created credit in the next three months but they can be anonymous. I think this anonymity, it's very important for society to function because a lot of transactions we make as humans we don't want to be, I am here my voice. Okay. We don't want to be always the person that we are, sometimes we want to hide our personality and this is very normal and very human.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Great. And I guess to follow up there. I mean with this specific question with both of you as the way you're thinking of your system is, if I wanted to register today before and I do also want to zoom into the idea of sort of a trust as a service provider within these systems, but before getting there if I wanted to register with either one of your systems once they're deployed in how you're envisioning the initial version, do I have to do that with a driver's license or a passport, or what is the actual specific mechanism that I as an individual would use to prove my identity?

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [29:52] So in our system, we sort of differentiate between the people who are creating ZUZ to the merchants who are like Blake's bakery, who are selling ZUZ as a way to raise some capital and the users of the system like Amari, who are buying those ZUZ and trading them. And so someone like Blake has to create a campaign, which they verify and they're going to need if they want people to trust it where it says no requirement, but if they want people to trust it they're going to put their incorporation documents or photos of their shop or whatever and then there's a protocol to verify that. Amari, on the other hand, she just needs to supply an email address or phone number and she gets less reputation in some sense but she's not staking any ZUZ, so that's okay.

**Cemil Turun:** [30:54] In our case, day one this time zero, initially we don't have reputation in our hands recorded in the system but eventually in time, okay, we will have many users with recorded transactions then there will be a built reputation. So in the first instance, in order to start the project, we will need to have already registered system of identities. So we will trust in the beginning some third-party, trust builders services to be provided to our assistance, which is not perfect. But I think we don't have another option until we create our own system of reputation.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [31:46] So just to add to that for a second, I think the other thing is that you can create verified identities that identify that the person is an individual and the same individual without actually revealing the data that they have.

**Cemil Turun:** Correct.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** So let's say they do provide a photo of their driver's license or their social security number, that then get encrypted as part of a hash for that user ID. And now we know that this is a real-world person with that data but not who it is.

**Cemil Turun:** Correct.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** It's up to them to decide how much they want to disclose.

**Cemil Turun:** [32:22] And also additional with Seth, when even that concealed identity, let's say a long hashed address of the person, sometimes other users notice that this is the same person who did such a transaction five days ago, you may need additional layers of anonymity in order to have real discreet transactional space.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [32:55] So I think it's an open question whether or not we truly need this. I think that when we think about privacy and anonymity, we tend to conflate two things and one is sort of the ability to be opaque and anonymous and the other is the ability to be forgotten. And I think that those two things are actually quite separate and one of the problems I think that we face as a society right now is that we conflate them and it would be nice to be able to sort of start over, but when you're in a community when you're in a network, I don't think there are actually significant social advantages for that community, for people to be opaque. So I think this is yet to be understood whether or not people actually need significant layers of anonymity on a system like this.

**Cemil Turun:** Yes, I agree.

**Eugene Leventhal:** And I guess to follow that thread a little more than taking a step back maybe to think about the general tensions between transparency and privacy, kind of how do you think through the balance between those two as you're both kind of designing these systems?

**Cemil Turun:** [34:11] Good question. As Seth said, these are two different things. And when it comes to actually conceal the transactions themselves and not necessarily conceal the person in his or her trust stability we are planning to use our, actually we are now using zero-knowledge systems mathematics that is to actually not show the actual transactions, but still keep them mathematically secure so that somebody who is asking the authenticity of the transactions, he or she can reveal mathematic proofs for these transactions. There is a balance between how you design the systems and how the users can understand what's going on user accessibility and ease of use. There is always these trade-offs and I think in the time we will find the best way to actually do this according to the community's needs.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [35:34] So I think at ZUZ we're being very careful to provide the mechanisms that are necessary, but not actually determine the policy. So for example, there is nothing that prevents a user from creating their own ZUZ and being completely anonymous. The question is, will anyone buy those ZUZ. So maybe there some risk-takers who are willing to receive a tremendous amount of interest and not know if they'll ever be able to redeem it. So I think that the users will make this decision and what will emerge from this process is we'll see what the cost of privacy is. Whether people actually want anonymity or not, or whether or not they'll see the benefit of sort of being transparent as a huge positive for the community that creates more economic value, tighter supply chains, and the other positives that come out of having the sort of transparent identity and transactions.

**Eugene Leventhal:** That also just makes me think about how interesting and challenging thinking through the governance of such systems on a community level can be, and how much variability do you want to give a community to really drive their own decision choice of that balance versus how much do you kind of prescribe it to say, hey, for a high probability of certainty to be able to support this trust in the first place you need to make the X-Y trade-offs specifically. That's just a very interesting balance and I guess, are there any other things that you would want community leaders to be thinking through specifically as they're going through this, especially if it's an initial design and they're not used to the full kind of the complexity of the mechanism design around these things?

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [37:32] So I think that which policies will work for which communities are going to depend on the community. So you can imagine synthesizing different kinds of financial instruments from these basic primitives of being able to issue trust lines for other people's currency, or being able to insure other people's currency, or setting up governance policies on the ledger that talk about a series of merchants sort of pooling together. And if one of them defaults the other one's picking up the slack, I mean, all of these different things come with trade-offs and I think it's a matter of sitting down and thinking about what your community needs, what are the goals that you're trying to achieve? Is it just raising capital? Is it trying to keep more trade local? Is it to support people in need? So those are three really different objectives that will require I think different mechanisms. And it's a matter of exploring those and thinking about which mechanisms you implement to get the policy that you want.

**Cemil Turun:** [38:46] Yeah. From the point of view of the existing Vadeli cheques, we noticed that it's a really decentralized system and it doesn't have any central authority or controlling mechanism or any third party that is recording what's going on. Actually, it's completely unrecorded in its present form. So I will suggest that the decentralized autonomous organization to operate and maintain this next monetary exchange system as we design it will be the best solution. But of course, this is open to debate. I don't know if Seth actually thinks in the same line, I think nobody should own the money although it is created by individuals with their own trust as a whole must not be owned by any central authority. That's what I think.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [39:49] So I agree that that we're long past the time of royally decreed currencies. I do think that there is a role for regulatory authorities to help manage the system, but in the end, I'm on the same page as Cemil. And when I talked about choosing the right mechanisms, I'm talking about a group of merchants coming together or a local library coming together and getting its patrons to figure out what policy they want. So it's community-driven but there is a role for government particularly in protecting public goods and trade in some sense as a public good or at least facilitating it.

**Eugene Leventhal:** And I think that the points you both just brought up marry very nicely to some other panels that we're hosting as part of the summit, as we have two specifically focused on governance and exploring Dows. So it'll be interesting to see if we can, at least on the forum get some kind of follow-up intersectional discussion there or maybe do some future event, but just keeping an eye on time for today that also just made me think about what kind of information is important to share across communities or within a single community and the structures for sharing that, whether it is something along the lines of policies and how do you let different communities know what are the policies being used and the pros and cons. I can see that quickly devolving into being information overload and a similar question, another two-part a similar question goes for bankruptcies. When someone fails within the system, do you just need the system to readjust, or for the trust-building, do you need to clearly communicate these types of things?

**Cemil Turun:** Please.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** So let's see two parts. The first part was-

**Cemil Turun:** Sharing policies and governance.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [41:50] Policies in some sense. So I do think that one of the main challenges that we're facing is the sort of, all of the flexibility here and the flexibility can lead to complexity. And I think that there probably will be some standard basic templates that work to achieve different goals. And I think that we're going to have to figure out what those templates are so that people can have a basic understanding of how this particular community put together their mechanisms. And then in the end community structures are not that different, not just within a country but across countries and human relationships, we're all humans. And I think that there will be a set of sort of standard templates that will become prevalent and people will pick and choose amongst those. And one of those policy decisions will be, the decision about how much to protect the consumers, the buyers of the ZUZ.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [43:06] So if a merchant does default, are they made good? Who eats that cost? And I think some communities will experiment with, what we want to fund as much entrepreneurial activity as possible and it'll be on the consumers. And others will say, we want to protect our consumers as much as possible so there'll be some fees that go into insurance pools, which are then redistributed back to merchants if no one fails, but otherwise are used to make consumers good. And so you can do either one under ZUZ and it's a matter of where you stand on, which of those policies you want to promote. And I have my own particular thoughts about that but I think it'll be up to the communities to explore that for themselves.

**Cemil Turun:** [43:57] Okay. In our present form, in the present form of our Vadeli cheque in Turkey, there is no insurance mechanism already built in the system. So there is a default possibility. And in the past 10 years' data, I have the data for past 15 years. 10 or 15 years the data shows that the default rate was less than 4% and between 1.5 and 3.5 usually average being 2.5 in the last 10 years. But still, is it possible to reduce this to much lower? Nobody actually did try to solve this because insurance companies never tried to insure this kind of debt although it is used widely in our country, all the insurance companies came from the West and they really didn't understand what's going on in that local mechanism.

**Cemil Turun:** However, in our own version building in-depth the protocol like Seth suggested that we are thinking of making a pool cut from one person from every transaction and put into pool. It's not an insurance but rather it's a peer-to-peer pool of financing for the debtors and if we know the percentage after a certain while we can securely put the right amount into the pool rather than making an aggregate of more than necessary. If there is more money in the pool at the end I don't know how to distribute it, these are all questions that we have to find out in practice.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [45:53] But the beauty of having a ledger on the smart contracts is that you can put these things together that are really factionist and low cost

**Cemil Turun:** Easy, very easy.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** Curving a tiny percentage out, much smaller than like Visa or MasterCard charges ends up being able to provide a huge social benefit.

**Cemil Turun:** [46:!4] Also in smart contract form set, we are we able to divide the credits into much smaller denominations which is very beneficial for the trades between smaller companies.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Absolutely. And I want to make sure to transition a little bit to specifically looking to some reputation-related questions in kind of following up on some threads that have been brought up throughout this discussion. And I think it's very interesting to think at the beginning especially how is reputation tracked or quantified to kind of get the system kicked off or does it start in a, we're all equally building reputation from time zero, everything before that sort of doesn't exist in the context of the system.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [47:07] So at least with ZUZ, the same kind of reputation you would use to do a crowd lending campaign is the reputation you would bring to the system. So you put together a campaign the way you would on GoFundMe or Kiva or something like that and it's your real-world reputation and the customers you have and the people in your community that you're going to reach out to. The reputation on the ledger, that's something that grows over time, and exactly how to quantify it I think is still open question, we're doing research in that area. I do think that we want to be careful and not include everything about every activity the person is doing or we can fall into some dystopian kind of scenarios. So there's a fine line, I don't know if it's a fine line but I think there is a line between tracking every single thing you do in your life and your sort of fiscal and commercial reputation that you're using to back these loans.

**Cemil Turun:** [48:23] This is also a very tough question to start time zero, T zero, how to start with credit if people already don't have accumulated scoring in your system, our plan is to start with AAA companies, and these companies have their own supply chain that goes really to many thousand smaller companies and entities. It looks like it's the easiest way to start for our system but we will see. If we started with AAA companies, essentially we are sure that this company is going to honor their debts when the time comes. So it looks like it's initially a good way to start, but time will tell us, we don't know it's a good way to actually find out the results very soon after starting the system.

**Eugene Leventhal:** And especially given how complex this is and especially from a quantification perspective, the whole idea of quantifying reputation is new and fraught with peril in its own as you alluded to. What do you see as some of the potential dangers of reputation-based systems or of relying on someone else's kind of trust mechanisms? Just thinking in the example you were just mentioning Cemil, assuming those companies have a good structure to verify all of their vendors and everyone they're working with, then there aren't as many concerns, but unfortunately, the history of recent decades shows many companies might cut corners there and might themselves end up trusting a party which maybe should not have been trusted. So do you see any particular dangerous to either reputation-based systems in the first place or more specifically to relying on someone else's kind of trust architecture when getting these systems built out?

**Cemil Turun:** [50:25] Well, I answer first, in our case we have already widely used quite big system being worked out or being used in the current Turkish economy also used in neighboring countries like Iran and Greece and Israel. So I think it is not a big, I don't see a big risk here when we kind of copy or put a similar system on a blockchain because we already have this running system. And also I must tell you that all digital invoices are attached to these transactions. We have another online digital invoicing system built by the government, and you can easily connect these two for larger transactions, not like the transactions in ZUZ maybe they're essentially community credit and they are actually backed by actual goods to be bought or services in the near future.

**Cemil Turun:** In the case of the Turkish version, there's always a real transaction backed by an invoice. So it's a real legal transaction we are talking about, however when it comes down to SMEs, smaller transactions are possible. In many cases, we hear that there are no invoices anymore, especially in agricultural transactions happening outside in the field. So essentially half of the transactions in Turkish current Vadeli cheque check system about half of them are not invoiced, but that doesn't mean they are black transactions. Mind you they're real world business, but not necessarily backed by government invoices. That means it's not taxed, when there is no invoice there's no tax involved.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [52:32] Again, go to the mechanism and policy. I think that if you provide people with the mechanisms then it's up to them to pick a policy in some sense, so if you're a business person you want to continue to do business. And so defecting from the system and not obeying the rules is going to have a larger penalty than the $50 or $500, or maybe even $50,000 that you scam somebody on. And so it's a matter of making sure the mechanisms are sound. On the flip side, you can imagine that in an ecosystem like this, there will be third parties that do things like ensure people's transactions or their deb for a fee or do look under the covers and look at their business practices and sort of add their own credit to it. But again, this is a distributed system that people will either pay for or not pay for. So it's a mechanism and people will have to choose the policy.

**Cemil Turun:** I completely agree, a 100% you've said.

**Eugene Leventhal:** And we unfortunately don't have the time to fully unpack, say the regulatory considerations as you're thinking through some of the mechanism designers as we just started touching on. But before we wrap up, I do just want to give both of you a chance to either mention any other elements of the project or just the chance to throw out any ideas that maybe we didn't get a chance to get to during this discussion.

**Cemil Turun:** [54:23] I want to thank you. And it was really interesting for me to see professor Goldstein's example, ZUZ. And it's really nice that we found a common ground between two projects, and I hope in the future we will be able to build internationally and globally working systems like this instead of a central money Fiat currency. And as he mentioned in several times in his speech, this is trading and community-based transactions are essential to human life. However, this currently is not really honored in such a way, so we have to build from bottom up again essentially human system just by humans for humans.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** [55:25] I want to thank you for inviting both of us. It was great to meet Cemil and hear that essentially this kind of thing has been going on for a long time. So I'm very pleased to, we're just going to reduce the frictions and make it easier to do. I think that both of these platforms not only offer people the opportunity of access to capital which we know will help reduce wealth inequality and increase the economic value in the community. But what they do is they encourage sort of local trading and so going local and tightening up supply chains in a way that I think will also help create circular economies, which will lead to just more sustainable economics.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** One of the things that people complain about with capitalism is no one prices in the externalities and so you can pollute for free or whatever, but as these systems grow larger and become more a part of how people are trading, those externalities will hurt your reputation, they'll be priced in. And so I think these kinds of approaches have the possibility of doing a lot of positive good, not just for individuals but for the world as a whole, and sometimes just to create more environmentally sustainable kind of economies.

**Eugene Leventhal:** Yeah. And I'll just say the circular economy and the note that you're ending on is music to my ears personally. And I'm very excited to see how both of your projects go and how a SCRF can generally be supportive as you're getting started. And I do just want to thank you again for taking the time to share your work and your thoughts today. Just want to mention for those who do want to continue the conversation beyond the summit, please feel free to check out [smartcontractresearch.org](http://smartcontractresearch.org/), where we're going to have a dedicated post to this panel with more information on both Cemil's and Seth's work. How to get in touch with them, how you can learn more about their projects, potentially get involved, and generally some more broad information on the topic so we can dig into some of the more challenging and open questions around these kinds of community-based currencies. So thanks again and enjoy the rest of the summer.

**Cemil Turun:** Thank you.

**Seth Copen Goldstein:** I look forward to the future conversation.

**Cemil Turun:** Me too. Thank you.
